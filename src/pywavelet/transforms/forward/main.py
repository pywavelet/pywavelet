    """
    Transform time-domain data to wavelet-domain data.

    This function performs a forward wavelet transform, converting a
    time-domain signal into a wavelet-domain representation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeseries : TimeSeries
        Input time-domain data, represented as a `TimeSeries` object.
    Nf : int, optional
        Number of frequency bins for the wavelet transform. Default is None.
    Nt : int, optional
        Number of time bins for the wavelet transform. Default is None.
    nx : float, optional
        Number of standard deviations for the `phi_vec`, controlling the
        width of the wavelets. Default is 4.0.
    mult : int, optional
        Number of time bins to use for the wavelet transform. Ensure `mult` is
        not larger than half the number of time bins (`Nt`). Default is 32.

    Returns
    -------
    Wavelet
        A `Wavelet` object representing the transformed wavelet-domain data.

    Warnings
    --------
    There can be significant leakage if `mult` is too small. The transform is
    only approximately exact if `mult = Nt / 2`.

    Notes
    -----
    The function warns when the `mult` value is too large, potentially leading
    to inaccurate results.
